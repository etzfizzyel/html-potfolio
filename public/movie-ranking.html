<h1>The Best Movies According to fizzyel</h1>
<h2>My top three movies of all-time.</h2>

<h3>Mr queen</h3>
<p>First thing that comes to my mind is that, it's a historical kdrama which was actually fun, had great comedy instead of the usual sad painful types. Every minute, every second, of each episode I was so thoroughly entertained. The cast is so perfect for their roles.The leads are so amazing. The script is so well written that you can never guess what will happen next . The chemistry between the leads is terrific.I love how the series makes you laugh even in the intense scenes. Literally a stress buster.
    There is no dull moments or boring part. The blend of historical and modern switch was very neat and smooth. Even amidst the tension between the political scenes, there was lot of entertainment.  MR QUEEN is highly recommended.

<h3>Alchemy of souls</h3>
<p>The chemistry between the leads (surprisingly for both seasons) was Top Tier. It has a lot of likable characters and all in all is just really good show I didn't expect to like it nearly as much as I did. It will make you laugh, cry and everything in-between.

<h3>Vincenzo</h3>
<p>This series is definitely worth watching.
    Lead actors have performed so well. The VINCENZO CASSANO ‚ù§ Song Joong ki's acting was on par excellence. I personally loved his charismatic personality. Female lead Hong cha young performed what she was asked to and she played well for the given witty, lunatic lawyer role. Tenants also did their job well.
